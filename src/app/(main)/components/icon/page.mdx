# {metadata.title}

A [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) icon.

These are different from (and supersede) the more common Material Icons (provided for example by `@mui/material-icons`).

## Props \{#props}

The same as Joy UI's [Card](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-card/) component, as well as:

- `icon`: The icon to display. A list of available icons can be found in `Icon.allIcons` or on the [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) website.
- `fill`, `weight`, `grade`, `opticalSize`: The Material Symbols properties of the icon.
- `size`: The size of the icon in pixels, if known.

## Examples \{#examples}
