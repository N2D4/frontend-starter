# {metadata.title}

Roughly equivalent to `<link rel="stylesheet">`, with some extra features.

## Props \{#props}

The same as HTML `<link>`, except for the following:

- `rel` is not available, as it is always set to `"stylesheet"`.
- `as` is not available.
- `defer`: If `true`, the stylesheet will be deferred to load at a later (unspecified) point in time. The current implementation loads the stylesheet only after the page has been hydrated.
