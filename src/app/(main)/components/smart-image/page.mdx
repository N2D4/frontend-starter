# {metadata.title}

An image component with more features and better defaults that [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image).

This should be used instead of `next/image` and `<img>` in all cases.

Notably, if you configured a `basePath` other than the root in `next.config.js`, this component will automatically prepend it to the `src` prop.

## Props \{#props}

The same as [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image) component, as well as:

- `disableStrictCLS`: Disables the Next.js CLS error. Particularly, this means you can not pass `width` and `height` even if the import is not static, and the component will behave like a normal `<img>` would. Note that this is frowned upon as it causes [cumulative layout shift](https://web.dev/articles/cls).<br />
