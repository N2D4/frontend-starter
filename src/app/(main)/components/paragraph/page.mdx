  title: "Paragraph",
};


# {metadata.title}

A paragraph or title of text.

If this paragraph is a heading (using one of the `h#` properties), and it has an ID, it will receive a "link" button on hover that will navigate to that heading.

In many cases, this can replace Joy UI's [Typography](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-typography/) component, however, you may still use Typography for purposes not served by this component.

## Props \{#props}

The same as Joy UI's [Typography](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-typography/) component, as well as:

- `body` or `sidenote` or `box` or `h1` or `h2` or `h3` or `h4` or `h5` or `h6`: A boolean that indicates whether the text is a body or a sidenote or a heading. The special value `block` can be used for more complex layouts where a margin is not wanted (eg. flexbox children in custom layouts), similar to Joy UI's [Box](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-box/) or HTML `<div>`.

## Examples \{#examples}

### Block text \{#block-text}
