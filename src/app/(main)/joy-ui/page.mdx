# {metadata.title}

This template makes heavy use of [Joy UI](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/) components. It was built on the same components as MUI's Material UI, but with more barebones styling that is easier to customize and doesn't look as much like Google.

It is recomended to stick with Joy UI components wherever possible, that means using [`Box`](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-box/) over `div`, [`Button`](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-button/) over `button`, etc.

[Joy UI's `Link`](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-link/) component is set up in a way that it always uses [Next.js' `Link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) component under the hood, providing you with advanced routing and prefetching capabilities.

## Styling & theming \{#styling-theming}

Modify the file in `src/theme.tsx` to customize Joy UI components. You can edit color themes, default props, and CSS variables.

In general, when customizing a component, use the following order of preference:

- **Props** like `color`, `variant`, `size`, etc. You can add custom [color palettes](https://mui.com/joy-ui/customization/theme-colors/#adding-new-palettes) and [variants](https://mui.com/joy-ui/customization/theme-colors/#adding-new-palettes) in `src/theme.tsx`.
- [**CSS variables**](https://mui.com/joy-ui/customization/using-css-variables/) like `--Button-radius` or `--Button-gap`.
- [**Inline styles**](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/) using the `sx` prop. These give you full flexibility on the component's CSS style. Joy UI uses [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) to compile these into a compact stylesheet, so you don't have to worry about performance. However, doing this on a per-component basis can lead to inconsistencies, and compatibility problems with other components.

### Why no Tailwind? \{#tailwind}

      - If you're scared of long variable names, you should probably use a different template.
      - If you don't want to learn CSS variables but already sunk cost into learning Tailwind (which is just as complicated at this point, and for the most part maps one CSS property into one type of Tailwind classes anyways), you should probably use a different template.
      - If you don't like code reusability and prefer just rewriting your components every single time, you should probably not use a template at all.
      - If you like to be constrained and don't want to be able to use advanced CSS features, you should probably stick to Squarespace.

## Template enhancements \{#template-enhancements}

If you've previously used Joy UI, this template also includes a few components that are built on-top of Joy UI components and should, in most cases, be used instead of the original Joy UI component. These are:

- **[`SmartLink`](/components/smart-link)** over [`Link`](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-link/) for smart external link detection, adding an indicator and opening a new tab automatically
- **[`Paragraph`](/components/paragraph)** over [`Typography`](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-typography/) for a paragraph component that includes margin defaults and links for titles
- **[`AsyncButton`](/components/async-button)** over [`Button`](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-button/) for a button that can be passed an async function in its `onClick` prop and will automatically show a loading indicator
- **[`AsyncIconButton`](/components/async-icon-button)** over [`IconButton`](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-icon-button/) for the same reason as `AsyncButton`
