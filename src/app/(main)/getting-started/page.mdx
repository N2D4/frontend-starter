## First steps \{#first-steps}

Either click the [Use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=frontend-starter&template_owner=N2D4) button on [our GitHub page](https://github.com/N2D4/frontend-starter) or initialize it using npm:

```sh
npm init @n2d4/frontend-starter ./my-project
```

Once you've cloned the repository, read the README.md file and follow the instructions there. Particularly, to start a local development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```


## Modifying code \{#modifying-code}

Your first step should be modifying the files in `src/app/(main)`. This is where you customize the pages of your website, including this very page you're reading right now.

You should think of this template as a starting point for your project and not a dependency. You should modify it to fit your needs, and there is absolutely no forwards-compatibility. Don't expect to be able to update the template to a new version.


## Working through TODOs \{#todos}

It is recommended to use TODOs to keep track of undone tasks. frontend-starter has special support for TODOs.

By using the string TODO{} ASAP anywhere in your code, you can create a blocking TODO item. If any are found in your repository, a notice will be displayed on every build. To see all blocking TODOs, run:

```sh
npm run todo
```

If you clone the repository from GitHub, it comes with a few TODOs already in place. Be sure to complete them before going into production.


## Fonts & styling \{#fonts-styling}

frontend-starter uses Vercel's [Geist Sans & Mono](https://vercel.com/font) font by default.

<Paragraph
  body
  sx={{
    fontFamily: 'inherit',
  }}
>
  Sometimes, you may see some text that is using a handwriting font like this. <Typography display="inline" component="span">This is a safeguard to make sure you wrap all text in a component that supports Joy UI styling. Usually, you would use `<Paragraph body />` (see [documentation](/components/paragraph)) or `<Typography />` for this purpose.</Typography>
</Paragraph>

For more about styling and CSS-in-JS, see the [page about Joy UI](/joy-ui).
