# Getting Started

## First Steps

Either click the [Use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=frontend-starter&template_owner=N2D4) button on [our GitHub page](https://github.com/N2D4/frontend-starter) or initialize it using npm:

```sh
npm init @n2d4/frontend-starter ./my-project
```

Once you've cloned the repository, read the README.md file and follow the instructions there. Particularly, to start a local development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```
