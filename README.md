This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped from [`N2D4/frontend-starter`](https://github.com/N2D4/frontend-starter). It also serves as its own documentation; follow the instructions below to get started.

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the documentation.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/(main)/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Customizing the app

We highly recommend first working through all TODO<!-- --> ASAP comments. You can find them by running:

```sh
npm run todo
```

Then, edit the `src/app/(main)` folder however you please. Refer to [the documentation](https://n2d4.github.io/frontend-starter) for more information.

## Building for production

To build the app for production, simply run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of the app in the `out/` directory. Please make sure to work through all TODOs in the `next.config.mjs` file first to ensure that the app is properly configured.
